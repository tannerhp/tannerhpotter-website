    <p> musings </p>

    <p> Beware those who tear down, criticize, and bemoan who don't offer rigorous solutions in return </p>
    <p> It is critical to consider optionality, i.e., the right but not the obligation, with the type of distribution, whether symmetric asymmetric or somewhere in between. </p>
    <p> Context. Study things in their context. See things in their context. Be you in your context. </p>
